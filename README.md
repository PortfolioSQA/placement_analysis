Overview:

A short feature importance analysis and comparison of college-level statistics placement between one community college district and the RP Group's state-level multiple measures results. Using decision trees, we find that predicting success in statistics is more accurate when the number of transferable units earned is considered rather than using high school GPA alone.  Additionally, approximately 60% of the students in the district are missing high school GPA for which a separate analysis is conducted.
